### DDoSecrets Collective

Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) is a publisher and archive for data leaked in the public interest, with news coverage from around the world.

We are a small group, but our reach expands far beyond just our members. Our founders had informally worked together and developed deep connections in the field of data gathering, research, journalism, activism and technology. In 2018, they decided to pool their expertise and time to create a project representing shared transparency goals, and provide an information sharing platform for others to know and trust.

Data we index must meet two criteria:
- Is it in the public interest?
- Can a prima facie case be made for the veracity of its contents?

Since 2018, we‚Äôve grown by leaps and bounds, released dozens of terabytes of data from over fifty countries, worked with countless outlets and partnered with groups like the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, European Investigative Collaborations, the SilverLining Project at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science and the Social Media Analysis Toolkit (SMAT).

Our view is that data is a resource and a record. Data can never tell the whole story. We trust the public to be responsible with data, and open it up to them for rigorous examination. Given enough time and data, the truth can always emerge.

As of July 2020, we are a registered 501(c)3 non-profit.
