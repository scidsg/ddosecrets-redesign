Records disclosed in litigation detailing alleged or actual child sexual
abuse activities by Boy Scouts of America employees or those applying to
work with BSA. Known internally as the "Ineligible Volunteer" files,
"perversion files" or "p-files", they reveal efforts to conceal and
manage endemic abuse within the organization. These records were
released as part of the court case Lewis v. Boy Scouts of America
following an unsuccessful appeal by the Boy Scouts to the Oregon Supreme
Court. Copies of the records were posted publicly in searchable formats
by the Los Angeles Times, Crew Janci LLP, and Paul Mones PC, two of the
law firms representing abuse victims.

Additionally, these files are not exhaustive and only comprise a small
sampling of records held by the organization. Over the course of the
case, it was determined that the Boy Scouts were aware of widespread
abuse possibly as early as 1914, with formal records being created
around 1920. The records released primarily span the period of 1965 to
1985; records obtained by the Los Angeles Times cover 1985 to 1991.
Files from Crew Janci are organized by exhibit number; files from the
Times by name.
