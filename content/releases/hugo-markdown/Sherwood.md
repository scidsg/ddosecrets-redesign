## Research

Unicorn Riot published details of an analysis of the locations of over
1,400 client accounts, finding: 780 from the Isle of Man, 272 from
Cyprus, 153 from the UK, 107 from the Cayman Islands, 51 from the
British Virgin Islands, 12 from the Seychelles, 11 from the United
States, 7 from Belize, 7 from Ireland, and also accounts from other
offshore banking destinations like Gibraltar, Jersey, Saint Kitts and
Nevis, Barbados, Guernsey, Malta, and
Mauritius.[[1]](https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/massive-hack-strikes-offshore-cayman-national-bank-and-trust/)

Global Witness investigated the Isle of Man's growing reputation for
acting as a tax haven for private jet purchases in Europe. One tax
consultant from Ernst & Young in 2011 called the Isle of Man: "user
friendly" and
"pro-business".[[2]](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/tax-haven-next-door/)The same Ernst & Young consultant advised
Appleby --- the law firm subject of the Paradise Papers --- on a $48
million jet purchase by Russian billionaire Oleg Tinkov. Tinkov was
indicted by a grand jury in the US in 2019, for tax
evasion.[[3]](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1249209/Russia-news-Oleg-tinkov-billionaire-bail-court)

> In the wake of the Paradise Papers in 2018, the European Commission
> urged the UK to clamp down on "abusive VAT practices in the Isle of
> Man". However, emails and bank records from Cayman National, seen by
> Global Witness, suggest that reducing or even eliminating VAT bills by
> establishing complex and artificial corporate structures was routine.

Global Witness concludes that Sherwood data proves that government
regulators have too cozy a relationship with the financial powers and
don't act as "custodians of the public interest".

Russian billionaire Oleg Tinkov appears in the Cayman National client
list. Story from The Times (UK)

[Hetq](https://hetq.am/en/article/116946) and the OCCRP reported that Armen Avetisyan, Armenia's
former head of customs, opened an account at Cayman National in 2012.
The account was flagged by the bank as early as 2014,"in light of large
and frequent deposits made by Avetisyan into (his account)-- funds
possibly from a corrupt source." The account was allowed to stay open
for four more years, and was used to fund the construction of a series
of hotels worth about $90 million. A corruption investigation in
Armenia against Avetisyan ended in 2019 when Avetisyan returned one of
his company's hotels, worth $15 million, to the control of the
Armenian state. The hotel remained empty until it became a COVID
quarantine center in
2020.[[4]](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/armenias-golden-palace-offshore-millions-evaded-investigators)

The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reported that Eldar
Mahmudov, who was Azerbaijan's minister of national security between
2003 and 2015, used his children Anar Mahmudov and Nargiz Mahmudova to
move at least €100 million out of Azerbaijan and into UK, Spain,
Luxembourg, Lithuania, and
Cyprus.[[5]](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/dethroned-azerbaijani-elites-made-big-investments-in-europe) Before 2003, Eldar Mahmudov had led the
economic crime unit within the Azeri ministry of internal
affairs.[[6]](https://www.transparency.org/en/news/who-is-opening-the-gates-for-kleptocrats#) Anar Mahmudov, his mother, and two sisters
received Lithuanian "golden visas" for the European Schengen zone in
2017. In 2018, Anar's mother-in-law Zamira Haciyeva, living in London,
was found to have spent more than £16.3 million at Harrods over the
course of a decade, as well as millions of pounds on property and $42
million on a private
jet.[[7]](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45812210) In Feb. 2020, Zamira Haciyeva lost her appeal against
Britain's first "unexplained wealth order," requiring her to reveal
the source of her wealth to the National Crime
Agency.[[8]](https://www.rferl.org/a/children-of-azerbaijani-ex-security-chief-acquired-luxury-properties-in-britain-investigation-finds/30644433.html) In May 2020, Transparency International UK's
director of policy told The Observer: "It is now important that there is
full transparency and the source of wealth for these investments is
investigated."[[9]](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/31/children-of-azerbaijan-minister-eldar-mahmudov-built-up-100m-property-and-business-empire)

## Aftermath

Belgium's ministry of finance announced it was investigating this data
set to search for tax
avoidance.[[10]](https://www.brusselstimes.com/news-contents/economic/85298/tax-authorities-investigate-new-leaks-incriminating-belgians/)

Economist Matthew Collin with the Brookings Institute published the
report What lies beneath: Evidence from leaked account data on how
elites use offshore
banking.[[11]](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2021/05/05/the-hacker-the-tax-haven-and-what-200-million-in-offshore-deposits-can-tell-us-about-the-fight-against-illicit-wealth/)
