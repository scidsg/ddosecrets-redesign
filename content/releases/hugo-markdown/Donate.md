## Donate

**Distributed Denial of Secrets is an independent transparency
collective, funded by supporters like you.** Since July 2020, we are
registered as a 501c3 nonprofit (EIN: 85-2177863) in the United States,
to facilitate small donations and to attract grants from funders that
share our values. We believe having a variety of funders protects our
independence and ability to publish, and when possible we mention the
sources of our funding [at our Open Collective
page](https://opencollective.com/ddosecrets).
