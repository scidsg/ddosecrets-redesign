79,000 emails from the OMEGA Company, the R&D department of Russia's
state-controlled pipeline company, Transneft / Транснефть. Transneft is
the world's largest oil pipeline company. The emails cover the
account's most recent activity, including after the introduction of
American sanctions on February 25, 2022. Some of the emails reflect some
of the effects of those sanctions.

In 2018, Transneft took over 31% of shares which belonged to the Russian
Federation in Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Transneft is operating over
70,000 kilometres (43,000 mi) of trunk pipelines and transports about
80% of oil and 30% of oil products produced in Russia.
