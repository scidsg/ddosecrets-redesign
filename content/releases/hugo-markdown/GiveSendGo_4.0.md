5 GB of files from GiveSendGo, including donor info for the Adopt A
Trucker campaign, a full 2.5 GB MySQL database dump, sourcecode for
their Bitbucket repo, information from their customer service systems
(such as FreshDesk), verification documents (may overlap with
[GiveSendGo 2.0](GiveSendGo_2.0.html "GiveSendGo 2.0")), a "schema
only" SQL file that seems to relate to GiveSendGo's crypto processing
plans, and Stripe data for the Freedom Convoy campaign and the Adopt A
Trucker campaign.
