| About us Greetings citizens of | |
| the world. Let us introduce | |
| ourselves... We are the Pwn-Bär | |
| international hack team. We stand | |
| for equal opportunity pwnage and | |
| unrestricted access to | |
| information. Our Russian APT | |
| friends seem kinda out of shape, | |
| don't they? Defacements? DDoS | |
| attacks? What year is this? 2012? | |
| We thought maybe they needed a | |
| little reminder of what real | |
| hacking is like, so we logged off | |
| Twitter to touch Shodan and we | |
| were shocked with what we saw. | |
| They have the most secure cybers | |
| in entire world and we could not | |
| hack them. Hahaha, just | |
| kidding... We announce the start | |
| of #OpCyberBullyPutin. We are | |
| going to show you how prepared | |
| for cyberwar Russia and CIS | |
| countries really are. We are | |
| Anonymous. We are a legion. We do | |
| not forgive. We do not forget. | |

Over 200 gigabytes of emails from the Belarusian weapons manufacturer
Tetraedr. Tetraedr has operated since 2001 and offers missile and gun
systems, air defense and surveillance radar systems, specialist
training, as well as system repair and upgrades.

The release consists of two parts. The first part is the most recent
1,000 emails from each inbox, in .EML format. The second part is a
complete archive of each inbox in .PST format, though the hackers note
that some .PST files may have corruption issues resulting from the
export process.

The hackers identify themselves as Anonymous Liberland and the Pwn-Bär
Hack Team on a .onion website which quietly began circulating and posted
the data in late February 2022. The site
[announced](./File:Tetraedr_site.png.html "File:Tetraedr site.png")
their opposition to Putin, Russia and CIS countries.

## Limited Distribution

Due to the PII in this dataset, the data is only being made available to
journalists and researchers. [(How to Request
Access)](Contact.html#Request_Access "Contact")

## Disclaimer

This dataset was released in the buildup to, in the midst of, or in the
aftermath of a cyberwar or hybrid war. Therefore, there is an increased
chance of malware, ulterior motives and altered or implanted data, or
false flags/fake personas. **As a result, we encourage readers,
researchers and journalists to take additional care with the data.**

This is a standard disclaimer that will be added to all datasets in the
[Cyberwar category](./Category:Cyberwar.html "Category:Cyberwar"), even
absent specific suspicions.

Any specific concerns will be added and noted below.

- Prior to DDoSecrets' announcement of the data, the hackers emailed
reporters at Insider, Motherboard and The Record with an email that
was signed with [Juan Andres
Guerrero-Saade's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLCVhh8gfIQ) name. After the email was made public
Anonymous Liberland [offered the
explanation](https://twitter.com/NatSecGeek/status/1497719313943474177) that "it was shade for [calling for phineas
and john doe to get
