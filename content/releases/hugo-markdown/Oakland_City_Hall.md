Internal emails and files from Oakland City Hall, a mid-sized city in
the San Francisco Bay area with a long history of [human rights
violations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/books/review/the-riders-come-out-at-night-ali-winston-darwin-bondgraham.html). The files contain information on active city
employees, including the current assignments of police officers,
documents of ongoing litigation against the city, and bank statements. A
review of files by DDoSecrets also found officer disciplinary records
including for supervisors that failed to intervene and report
misconduct.
