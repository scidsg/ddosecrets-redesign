[Help](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Export)

You can export the text and editing history of a particular page or set
of pages wrapped in some XML. This can be imported into another wiki
using MediaWiki via the [import
page](./Special:Import.html "Special:Import").

To export pages, enter the titles in the text box below, one title per
line, and select whether you want the current revision as well as all
old revisions, with the page history lines, or the current revision with
the info about the last edit.

In the latter case you can also use a link, for example
[Special:Export/Distributed Denial of
Secrets](./Special:Export/Distributed_Denial_of_Secrets "Special:Export/Distributed Denial of Secrets")
for the page "[Distributed Denial of
Secrets](../index.php.html "Distributed Denial of Secrets")".
