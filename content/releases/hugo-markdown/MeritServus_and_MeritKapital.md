Over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails from MeritServus and MeritKapital,
which provide corporate registration, administration, asset management
and holding company services along with golden passport services.

MeritServus was a division of Deloitte from 1988 until a management
buyout in 2005, and maintains ties to Deloitte Cyprus.

The data reveals the beneficial owners of the shell companies set up by
these firms, as well as the transfer of shares, banking documents and
other business products. MeritServus and MeritKapital's beneficial
owner is Demetris Ioannides, who until the day Russia invaded Ukraine,
[was a trustee of the Cyprus trust of Russian oligarch Roman
Abramovich](https://archive.vn/S0nqD),
former owner of Chelsea F.C.
