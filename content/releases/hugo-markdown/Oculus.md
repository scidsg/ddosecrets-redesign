The source code of the neural network (AI) scanner used by Russia's
censorship office to detect "objectionable" material online, such as
"propaganda" relating to gender and sexuality, instructions on weapons
or drugs, signs of extremism and terrorism and "misinformation" or
disrespect that discredits official state sources.

Due to being trained on it, the source code et al may include some
objectionable material such as nazi imagery, etc.
