**EDITOR NOTES**

---

Approximately 1.2 TB of files from Technoserv (now T1 Integration), a
group of IT companies specializing in  system integration, networking
and cloud services, information security, and datamining.

According to the hackers, the data includes approximately million files
of AutoCAD designs, contracts with clients and partners, and employee
PII.

## Limited Distribution

Due to presence of PII such as identification documents and other
concerns (see below), the data is only being made available to
journalists and researchers. ([How to Request
Access](Contact.html#Request_Access "Contact"))

## Disclaimer

This dataset was released in the buildup to, in the midst of, or in the
aftermath of a cyberwar or hybrid war. Therefore, there is an increased
chance of malware, ulterior motives and altered or implanted data, or
false flags/fake personas. **As a result, we encourage readers,
researchers and journalists to take additional care with the data.**

This is a standard disclaimer that will be added to all datasets in the
[Cyberwar category](./Category:Cyberwar.html "Category:Cyberwar"), even
absent specific suspicions.

Any specific concerns will be added and noted below.

- There is [debate about the existence and
claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Army_(Russia)#Debate_over_existence_and_claims "wikipedia:National Republican Army (Russia)")
of the group taking credit for the hack.
- The source delivered the files [through an
intermediary](https://twitter.com/officejjsmart/status/1582307562317570049), and declined our request to contact us.
- There were inconsistencies in what was communicated, like various
overly speculative, exaggerated, and misleading statements about the
data, and its implications.
- There was repeated pressure to publish immediately (which we
declined to do).
- It feels like a psychological operation.
