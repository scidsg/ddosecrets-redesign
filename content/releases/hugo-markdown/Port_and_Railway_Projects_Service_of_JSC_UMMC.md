77,500 emails from Port and Railway Projects Service of JSC UMMC /
Служба по портовым и железнодорожным проектам (ОАО УГМК), which operates
the two largest ports in Russia specializing in coal shipments.

These ports have maximized their cargo turnover through cooperation with
JSC Russian Railways / ОАО Российские железные дороги (ОАО РЖД), which
delivers coal from the mining sites to the ports.

Coal shipments from these ports go to more than 30 countries including
South Korea, Japan, China, Norway, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy,
Slovenia, Finland, Brazil, Israel, and Turkey.
