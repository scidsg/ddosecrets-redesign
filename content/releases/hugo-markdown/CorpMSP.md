Over 480 GB and 75,000 files, emails and disk images from CorpMSP, a
federal institution providing support to small and medium-sized
businesses. The controlling shareholder of CorpMSP is the Russian
Federation.

[According to
NB65](https://twitter.com/xxNB65/status/1518594916431060992/photo/1), CorpMSP is also allegedly used as a shell company
for digital spies, and maintains contracts with the Ministry of Defense.
The [files which documented these
allegations](https://twitter.com/xxNB65/status/1519772298282254341) were quickly [removed from
Mega](https://twitter.com/xxNB65/status/1520037618670526467), which allegedly hosted NB65's only copy.
According to NB65, the 9GB of files included client contracts and image
files of Ministry of Defense contracts.
