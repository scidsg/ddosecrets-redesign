Site text: Anonymous Liberland and the Pwn-Bär Hack Team Pom-Bear Mascot
About us

Greetings citizens of the world. Let us introduce ourselves... We are
the Pwn-Bär international hack team. We stand for equal opportunity
pwnage and unrestricted access to information.

Our Russian APT friends seem kinda out of shape, don't they?
Defacements? DDoS attacks? What year is this? 2012?

We thought maybe they needed a little reminder of what real hacking is
like, so we logged off Twitter to touch Shodan and we were shocked with
what we saw. They have the most secure cybers in entire world and we
could not hack them.

Hahaha, just kidding...

We announce the start of #OpCyberBullyPutin. We are going to show you
how prepared for cyberwar Russia and CIS countries really are.

We are Anonymous. We are a legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget.
Expect us. News The Unitary Enterprise "Tetraedr" Country: Belarus,
Category: Military-industrial complex

The TETRAEDR UE is a scientific and industrial private unitary
enterprise specializing in development and manufacture of advanced
radio-electronic weapon systems, development and manufacture of hardware
and software used in radar and radio electronic control assets,
upgrading of Air Defense Missile Systems.

190233544. The TETRAEDR UE is a full member of the Belarusian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.

hacked them and copied their mailspools.

If you saw pictures from Russian state TV of missiles being fired at
military training in Belarus, included are the schematics for some of
those SAMs, and email threads that might be of interest to researchers
of Belarusian involvement in the international arms trade.
