associated with the credit reporting agency Experian. An initial
examination of the dataset indicates it includes over 200,000 emails,
50,000 documents, and nearly 750,000 images.

## Limited Distribution

At this time, the majority of the data is only being provided directly
to journalists and researchers.

## Chicago emails

In light of the [killing of Adam
Toledo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Adam_Toledo "wikipedia:Killing of Adam Toledo"),
we have decided to publish a cache of tens of thousands of emails from
the City of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department. These emails were
apparently provided to Jones Day as part of a [review of the city's
policies](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/12/22/22195516/chicago-police-raid-search-warrant-anjanette-young-investigation-ann-claire-williams-lightfoot) in response to the [botched Chicago police
raid](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/12/17/you-have-the-wrong-place-body-camera-video-shows-moments-police-handcuff-innocent-naked-woman-during-wrong-raid/) on the home of [social worker Anjanette Young in
2019](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2021/02/19/anjanette-young-sues-chicago-police-city-of-chicago-in-state-court-for-botched-raid-where-she-was-handcuffed-naked/).

The mailboxes belong to [Tamika
Puckett](https://twitter.com/fspielman/status/1323295144695746561) (**Chief Risk Officer**), Anjali Julka (**FOIA
Officer**), Patrick Mullane (**Deputy Press Secretary**) and [Susan
Lee](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/10/02/lightfoots-deputy-mayor-for-public-safety-susan-lee-stepping-down/) (**Deputy Mayor of Public Safety**). While it's
likely that the emails don't represent a complete copy of what Jones
Day received and reviewed, there's no doubt that they represent an
unprecedented and unredacted look at the policies and operations of the
City of Chicago and one of the most disturbing police departments in the
history of America.

**Note:** Due to the way the emails were extracted and converted from
.PST files (Outlook) to .EML (raw email) by the hackers, some contact
and calendar information may incorrectly display as emails, and DKIM
verification may not work.

## Download

The torrent file for the 4.6 GB of Chicago emails can be downloaded
[here](../images/e/e7/City_of_Chicago_emails_-_Jones_Day.zip.torrent) or using the [magnet
link](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e764146a0a1e406971cd3c62d482ed746fe202dd&dn=emails.zip&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce).

The Chicago emails that Distributed Denial of Secrets is making
available to the public represent less than 5% of the Jones Day cache.
