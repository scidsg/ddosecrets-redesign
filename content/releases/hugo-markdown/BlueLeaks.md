**EDITOR NOTES**

---

**BlueLeaks**, sometimes referred to by the hashtag **#BlueLeaks**, is
269 gigabytes of internal U.S. law enforcement data obtained by the
hacktivism collective Anonymous and released on June 19, 2020.

The data---internal intelligence, bulletins, emails, and reports---was
produced between August 1996 and June 2020 by more than 200 law
enforcement agencies, often using [fusion
centers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/why-fusion-centers-matter-faq). According [to media
reports](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files-from-hundreds-of-police-departments/) and a statement from the company, the data was
obtained through a security breach of Netsential, a web developer that
works with law enforcement. The director of Netsential, Stephen
Gartrell, won recognition [from the Houston FBI in
2011](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/partnerships_and_outreach/community_outreach/dcla/2011/houston-1) "for his work designing and hosting websites that
educate the public about crime and terrorism."

## Research

Early research happened via social media. Elijah Daniel wrote on Twitter
to his 800,000+ followers "The FBI is watching all tweets regarding the
protests, and sending them to your local
police"[[1]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/06/22/blueleaks-huge-leak-of-police-department-data-follows-george-floyd-protests/#43b32504509b) and encouraged people to download the data
and find stories. Before it was
[banned](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/10/reddit-bans-forum-dedicated-to-blueleaks-data-dump/), r/blueleaks had thousands of posts on Reddit and
was used by
journalists.[[2]](https://twitter.com/colleenhagerty/status/1281619879653597184)

In Maine, a whistleblower lawsuit had been filed by former state trooper
George Loder in
[May](https://mainernews.com/maine-spy-agency-spread-far-right-rumors-of-blm-protest-violence/), against the Maine Information and Analysis
Center:

> "alleging police illegally collected personal data on gun owners,
> protesters and counselors at an international camp for Arab and
> Israeli
> teens."[[3]](https://bangordailynews.com/2020/06/26/mainefocus/hundreds-of-records-hacked-from-maine-intelligence-agency/)

June 24, Maine Department of Public Safety commissioner Michael Saushuck
faced questions about the activities of their fusion center at a
legislative hearing and "was unable to provide clear answers on how
much time is spent by agents of the center collecting information on
political
activists."[[4]](https://mainebeacon.com/data-breach-exposes-activities-of-maines-secretive-police-intelligence-agency/)The Maine fusion center was found to be
sending their reports about political activists to ExxonMobil, Lockheed
Martin, Emera, Irving Oil, Hannaford's and other large corporations and
lobbyists.[[5]](https://mainebeacon.com/maines-police-intelligence-center-sent-reports-on-activists-to-corporations/)

## Aftermath

[Musk's "Free Speech" Twitter still censoring DDoSecrets: Twitter has
censored the website of nonprofit transparency collective Distributed
Denial of Secrets for more than two
years](https://theintercept.com/2022/11/22/elon-musk-twitter-censor-ddosecrets/) (The Intercept)

Rep. Charlotte Warren, chair of the Maine House legislature's Criminal
Justice committee, called for their fusion center's "$700,000 annual
budget to be redirected to serve other
needs."[[6]](https://mainebeacon.com/maines-police-intelligence-center-sent-reports-on-activists-to-corporations/)

On June 23, Twitter suspended @DDoSecrets and blocked users from
tweeting any DDoSecrets URLs, falsely claiming that the site "may
install malware, steal passwords or other sensitive data, or collect
personal data for purposes of sending
spam."[[7]](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/twitter-terminates-ddosecrets-and-falsely-claims-it-may-infect-visitors/)[[8]](https://www.tsf.foundation/blog/twitter-removes-account-for-pointing-users-to-leaked-documents-obtained-by-a)

Documents obtained by Lucy Parsons Lab through Freedom of Information
show the Department of Homeland Security on June 29 circulated
intelligence accusing DDoSecrets of being the "criminal hackers"
behind the
breach.[[9]](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21365448/blueleaks-dhs-distributed-denial-secrets-dds-ddosecrets-police)

On July 2, a public access server for DDoSecret's Hunter Memorial
Library was seized by Germany's Zwickau state prosecutors, at a Hetzner
data center. Hetzner waited until July 7 to notify DDoSecrets of the
seizure. German [newspaper Die Zeit
reported](https://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2020-07/blueleaks-ddosecrets-whistleblower-server-beschlagnahmt):

> A spokesman for the public prosecutor admitted on the phone that they
> knew that DDoSecrets was a journalistic project, but did not want to
> provide any further information. Since it is about an American
> procedure, no information is given. The communication states that the
> seizure is "a provisional measure". Only when the official request
> for legal assistance has been received will "an examination be
> carried out as to whether and to what extent a judicial seizure of
> data for the purpose of surrendering it to the US authorities as
> evidence is possible".

On July 16, three ICE agents identifying themselves as Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) interviewed an archivist involved in a mirror site
in Boston, Massachusetts. The archivist said the three ICE agents
"described BlueLeaks without mentioning it by name, and then proceeded
to talk about how (the mirror site) was hosting (BlueLeaks). They asked
me if I knew anything about it and what my involvement was. I asked if
they were referring to BlueLeaks and they said yes... (they) eventually
asked me to become an informant and offered to pay me for any
information that led to
arrests."[[10]](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg84ww/ice-questions-admin-of-the-eye-archive-site-hosted-blue-leaks)

Aug. 4, a reporter from The Intercept wrote: "The actions against
DDoSecrets publishing BlueLeaks data are a lot more aggressive than
anything we've seen before in past data leaks. I think it's because
American police have an incredible amount of political power and feel
very threatened by this data being out
there."[[11]](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i3nnup/were_an_investigative_reporter_and_the_director/g0cqeln/)

Oct. 17, Twitter [updated their policy on
distribution](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-hacked-materials-rule-change-impossible-needle/) of hacked materials to allow a New York Post
story,[[12]](https://news.yahoo.com/facebook-says-choking-spread-controversial-164914171.html) but did not unblock DDoSecrets
URLs.[[13]](https://gizmodo.com/no-twitter-did-not-stop-blocking-urls-and-hacked-conte-1845393137) Bellingcat reported URL shorteners could
bypass the
censorship.[[14]](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/case-studies/2020/10/14/testing-twitters-methods-of-restricting-blocked-links-and-domains/) Commentators questioned why despite the
policy change Twitter continues to censor DDoSecrets URLs and user
accounts.[[15]](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-hacked-materials-rule-change-impossible-needle/)[[16]](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/16/1010609/facebook-and-twitters-no-win-situation-over-biden/)
