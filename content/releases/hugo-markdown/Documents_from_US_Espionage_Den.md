**EDITOR NOTES**

---

In November 1979, Iranian students seized an entire archive of CIA and
State Department documents, which represented one of the most extensive
losses of secret data in the history of any modern intelligence service.
Even though many of these documents were shredded into thin strips
before the Embassy, and CIA base, was surrendered, the Iranians managed
to piece them back together. They were then published in 1982 in dozens
of volumes under the title "Documents From the U.S. Espionage Den."
