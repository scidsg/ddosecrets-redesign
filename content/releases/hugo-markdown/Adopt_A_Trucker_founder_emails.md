250 MB of emails and attachments from the Protonmail account of Adopt A
Trucker campaign founder, Chris Garrah. The emails run from February 7th
through the morning of February 21st.

The source noted that while they were able to remove some malware from
the original inbox, it is possible that some was missed. Therefore, they
recommend that the files be sandboxed and scanned with the appropriate
antivirus software.

Due to the PII scattered throughout the emails and attachments, the
dataset is only being offered to journalists and researchers at this
time.
