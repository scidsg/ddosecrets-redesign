Liberty Counsel helped overturn Roe v. Wade, and [claim to have
prayed](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/roe-supreme-court-justices-1378046/) with Supreme Court justices. This release also
includes more than 100 internal databases from mostly Christian
missionary groups that use the same software for customer relationship
management (CRM), called WMTEK. WMTEK develops software exclusively for
non-profits that are supposedly Christian.

This collection includes about 450GB of databases once uncompressed, as
well a git repositories and files found in the webroots of web servers.
The data spans from 2015 to 2022 and includes PII for donors and
supporters of these groups, as well as details about financial
transactions. All together, these databases track hundreds of millions
of dollars in donations to Christian groups.

The Liberty Counsel database is 25GB uncompressed, and includes 262,000
people, 44,000 who are donors.
