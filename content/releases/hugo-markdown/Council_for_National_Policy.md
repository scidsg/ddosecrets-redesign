An unredacted copy of the highly restricted September 2020 membership
directory for the Council for National Policy, an umbrella organization
and networking group for conservative and Republican activists in the
United States.

The group has been described by the *New York Times* as "a little-known
club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the
country" and by *The Nation* as "a secretive organization that
"networks wealthy right-wing donors together with top conservative
operatives to plan long-term movement strategy."
