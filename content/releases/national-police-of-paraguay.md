Over 500,000 internal documents and images from the National Police of Paraguay (Policía Nacional del Paraguay), and 175 gigabytes of SQL databases.

The data includes documents from the Internal Affairs Directorate (Dirección de Asuntos Internos), the Identification Department (Departamento de Identificaciones) and the Foreigners Registry Department (Departamento Registro de Extranjeros), Technology and Development Division (Division de Tecnologia y Desarrollo), as well as other documents including orders from command, photographs of evidence and documents about wanted individuals.

Due to the presence of PII such as booking photographs and incident reports, the data is only being made available to journalists and researchers.
