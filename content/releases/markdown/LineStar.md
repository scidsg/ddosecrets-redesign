## Redactions

For usability and to reduce the potential for abuse, approximately 19
gigabytes of .DLL files and AppData were filtered out of the original
cache. An additional 10 gigabytes of Human Resource files were redacted
for PII.

## Emails

73,512 emails have been converted from PST to EML format. The extracted
and converted emails can be downloaded
[here](../images/4/49/Pipelinemail.torrent). Due to the way the emails were extracted and converted,
they may not pass DKIM inspection. Forensic evaluation should only be
performed on the original archives, as the conversions are provided only
for convenience of journalists and other researchers.
