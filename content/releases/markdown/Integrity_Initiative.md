Integrity Initiative was a non-profit that counters Russian propaganda.
It appeared to have confirmed the hack, but has not reviewed the
individual documents. Anonymous took credit for the hack and published
the files on the now defunct website CyberGuerrilla. However,
allegations surfaced that [Russia was responsible for the
hack](https://www.insider.com/russia-hack-on-institute-for-statecraft-tactics-in-west-2019-12).
