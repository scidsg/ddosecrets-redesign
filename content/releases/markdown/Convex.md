120 gigabytes from the Russian internet provider Convex, revealing
pervasive Russian surveillance of internet and phone activities,
including the previously unknown Green Atom surveillance program.

In 2015, the European Court of Human Rights
[warned](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-159324%22%5D%7D) in *[Zakharov v.
Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakharov_v._Russia "wikipedia:Zakharov v. Russia")*
that the legislation underpinning Russia's [System for Operative
Investigative
Activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM "wikipedia:SORM")
surveillance system did "not provide for adequate and effective
guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse which is inherent
in any system of secret surveillance" and that the requirements for
legal authorization could be circumvented. In 2016, the [Yarovaya
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarovaya_law "wikipedia:Yarovaya law")
was passed and went into effect in 2018, requiring that all
communications information be provided to authorities [without a court
order](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/12/russia-big-brother-law-harms-security-rights).

According to the hackers, the Green Atom data confirms the extent to
which these legal structures are abused. They say the internet provider
captured and mirrored virtually all data from every switch in the
largest regions of Russia, which is then passed on to Moscow for use by
the security services. The hackers wrote in an email [to the Kyiv
Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/11706):

> 'Green Atom' (TS ORM fsb) refers to the installation and maintenance
> of wide-ranging surveillance equipment that is used to monitor the
> online activity of all traffic in and out of Convex. This can be
> classified as espionage, unauthorized wiretapping, and surveillance of
> civilians without a warrant.
