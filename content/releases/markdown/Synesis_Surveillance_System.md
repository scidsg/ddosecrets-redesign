1.2 GB of videos and data on the Synesis and Kipod surveillance system
and software deployed in Belarus in elsewhere. The Synesis company
[skirted United States sanctions which echoed EU sanctions against the
company](http://synesis.by/tpost/bslcgdriy1-synesis-is-under-us-sanctions-echoing-eu) imposed in response to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.

The data was gathered in August 2020. It was provided to DDoSecrets now
in response to the [Belarusian government taking control of the
system](http://synesis.by/tpost/tmi65le781-247-panoptes-will-cease-to-perform-the-f). According to a statement on the company's
website, the transition of control of the system will result in the end
of the Kipod software.
