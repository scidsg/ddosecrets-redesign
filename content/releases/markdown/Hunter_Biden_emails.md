Approximately 128,500 emails allegedly from the Hunter Biden laptop. The
emails are primarily dated between 2009 and 2019. There are some
anomalies with the dates and the number of emails, in addition to
concerns about the chain of custody. **There are considerable issues
with this dataset *including signs of tampering***. See below.

More than one altered or implanted emails was detected in a version of
this dataset, which is being distributed by Trump allies and former
staffers. The known possibly tampered emails were created between August
31, 2020 and September 2, 2020. The existence of other possibly tampered
emails cannot be ruled out. See also:
[Timeline](Hunter_Biden_emails.html#Timeline "Hunter Biden emails")
below.

We present the dataset now in full context to counteract possible
deceptions by persons with an agenda who are currently distributing the
dataset without the relevant context or warnings.

## **Origins of the Laptop**

According to a 2022 [CBS News
report](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-laptop-photo/), one of Hunter Biden's laptops was left in the
Newburyport, Massachusetts's office of his therapist, Dr. Keith Ablow.
The office was later raided in an unrelated later, and the laptop was
seized by the DEA.

A few weeks later, what Hunter Biden's lawyers say was a different
laptop was allegedly left with a legally blind man at a computer repair
shop, along with other laptops. Though the computer store clerk, John
Paul Mac Isaac, is unable to identify the person who left the laptops,
the paperwork allegedly identified Hunter Biden. The laptops were never
picked up by the owner, and eventually considered abandoned property.

John Paul Mac Isaac has said that he first saw and read or reviewed some
of the files on the machines while performing the file recovery. He said
he found these files interesting and alarming, which led to him making
contact with the FBI and others, at times through proxies such as his
father.

Hunter Biden has [neither confirmed nor
denied](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/02/politics/hunter-biden-laptop/index.html) the authenticity of the laptops from the repair
shop. DDoSecrets has detected **some** irregularities and modifications
of the dataset as presented by the Trump allies and former staffers,
which warrant further investigation. We have made the decision to
release the data with the analysis and warnings detailed below.

## **Source issues and discrepancies**

As reported by The Daily Beast, [John Paul Mac Isaac has contradicted
himself
repeatedly](https://www.thedailybeast.com/man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview) (see
[here](https://soundcloud.com/rptrbnd/mac-shop-10-14-cm) for audio). CBS also noted [he contradicted himself in
his interview with
them](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-laptop-new-york-post-story/), and invoked debunked conspiracy theories like
Seth Rich. He has declined to clarify his relationship with Giuliani,
indicating to The Daily Beast that he doesn't want to discuss "details
that transpired between December 9th and the beginning of September."

Notably, Mac Isaac has since [warned about false
claims](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/12/now-warning-about-hunter-biden-laptop-disinfo-guy-who-leaked-it/) others have made about the contents of the
laptops.

For additional source and chain of custody issues, see [Timeline
discrepancies](Hunter_Biden_emails.html#Timeline_discrepancies "Hunter Biden emails").

## **Involvement of Trump, Giuliani, Bannon and other Trump staffers**

Rudy Giuliani, former-President Trump's lawyer, received a copy of some
of the data sometime in 2019 or 2020. [According to a defamation court
filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.587211/gov.uscourts.flsd.587211.44.0.pdf), in August 2020, Mac Isaac contacted Rudy
Giuliani's lawyer, Mr. Costello, and provided him with the data. Mac
Isaac's court filing in the defamation suit states that he never
communicated with Giuliani, a statement which appeared contradicted by
his various interviews (see below).

In an attempt to [swing the 2020 election with an October
Surprise](https://www.vox.com/2020/10/14/21515776/hunter-biden-emails-giuliani), Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani [provided the data
to the New York
Post](https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-boasted-on-dutch-tv-weeks-ago-that-he-had-hunter-bidens-hard-drive).

According to multiple sources, then-President Trump [had been aware of
the effort to publish data from the
laptop.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-knew-for-weeks-that-rudy-giulianis-hit-on-hunter-biden-was-coming) According to Giuliani, in addition to [briefing
Trump](https://www.thedailybeast.com/rudy-giuliani-says-theres-only-5050-chance-i-worked-with-a-russian-spy-to-dig-dirt-on-bidens), he alerted Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) and
Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Giuliani believed Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California)
also received the data.

The cache of ~128.5k emails was first circulated online by Garrett
Ziegler, a former associate director in Trump advisor Peter Navarro's
Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. Garrett Ziegler also
distributes an alleged copy of [Ashley Biden's stolen
diary](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/us/politics/project-veritas-ashley-biden-diary.html) and pushes false QAnon talking points such as
COVID-19 being a "plandemic", or that new variants of COVID-19 are
financial schemes. COVID-19 is a deadly virus, and not a planned
pandemic.

## Last modified dates

In the emails' native format, the .emlx files show 145 distinct "last
modified" dates ranging from January 4th, 2018 - May 8th, 2022. The
modification dates could reflect many things, including the date the
files were exported or recovered, and do not necessarily indicate
tampering.

The dates do, however, form a timeline worth examining, particularly
alongside the Timeline discrepancies above and [the Washington Post's
findings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-laptop-data-examined/) about external access and modified files. The days
with the largest number of modifications are February 9th and 11th,
2019, August 17, 2021, September 1st through 4th, 2021, and October 4th
2021.

The overlap between these dates and the dates of the tampered emails, in
addition to the overlap between these dates and the dates of the new
folders that were created on the laptop hard drive [detected in the
Washington Post's
analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-laptop-data-examined/) (included in the timeline above).

## **Allegations of State Sponsorship**

[Dozens of former intelligence
officials](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276) have co-signed a letter that said the Hunter Biden
laptop affair "has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information
operation." Then-Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe
[contradicted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/19/russian-disinformation-not-behind-biden-emails-dni-ratcliffe-says/3712484001/) this allegation of state sponsorship. The matter
is under FBI investigation.

During this time period, Giuliani has met with and worked with Andrii
Derkach, who [the Treasury Department
considers](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1118) "an active Russian agent" and who was [alleged
by the DNI to be using
leaks](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public) to undermine the candidacy of Joe Biden. Giuliani
[estimated the odds that he'd worked with a Russian
spy](https://www.thedailybeast.com/rudy-giuliani-says-theres-only-5050-chance-i-worked-with-a-russian-spy-to-dig-dirt-on-bidens) "no better than 50/50". According to Derkach,
the ["incriminating" information is on the second
laptop](https://time.com/5902557/hunter-biden-rudy-giuliani-ukraine/) - further indicating his possible involvement.

## **Email count discrepancy**

An early analysis by [Maryman and Greenfield on behalf of the Daily
Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9445105/What-Hunter-Biden-left-tell-memoir-revealed.html) identified 154,000 emails. According to the [Daily
Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10825801/Former-Trump-aide-posts-huge-trove-120-000-Hunter-Biden-emails-abandoned-laptop.html), this cache contains 128,775 emails . The cache
contains that many files, however several of the files are not emails,
and are instead contacts or appointments in .emlx or .eml format. In a
more recent Daily Mail article, they refer to the original cache they
shared with Maryman and Greenfield as containing 142,838 emails.

## **Attempts at verification**

Approximately [22,000 emails from a similar cache* have been
verified](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-laptop-data-examined/) using DKIM or ARC. This [Washington Post
analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-laptop-data-examined/) notes files and directories were created after the
date the laptop would have allegedly left Hunter Biden's custody.
**Several of these dates coincide with dates where emails have been
inserted into the cache.**

It's unknown if the intent was to highlight these for research use, or
if it was part of a failed attempt to edit and implant emails. It is
possible they were deliberately sloppy attempts, and that more
sophisticated attempts to modify the contents of the dataset remain.

Reports on the analysis by Maryman & Associates offers surface
verification of the data while raising significant questions.

1. How would the pair of laptops dropped off in April 2019 include
emails up to December 2020?
2. Why does the Daily Mail have two different counts of the number of
emails they analyzed?

Further, [diligent
attempts](https://twitter.com/RidT/status/1316370155966996480) at verification are imperative for any reporting
on the substance of the emails and any other associated materials.

*While the Washington Post described the email cache as having a
similar amounts of documents, they listed its size as 4.3 gigabytes. We
have mirrored the 3.6 gigabyte cache as published by Garrett Ziegler.
The cause of this dataset size discrepancy is not known.
