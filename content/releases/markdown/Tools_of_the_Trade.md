## Tips

## Use seedboxes as sandboxes

Seedboxes not only offer a way to more quickly and discretely download
data, some also offer remote desktop access (or SSH access and the
opportunity to install your own remote desktop client). This allows
users to access the data directly on the seedbox, without having to open
it on a local machine, both cutting down on the time required to access
it, and reducing the risk.
