Donor information for every campaign on the 'Christian fundraising
platform' GiveSendGo, best known for being used by [far-right
extremists](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/us-far-right-extremists-millions-social-cryptocurrency) like [the Proud
Boys](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/us-far-right-extremists-millions-social-cryptocurrency). The site has allegedly also been used to [fund
and defend
insurrectionists](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3v985/the-proud-boys-went-incognito-during-the-insurrection-to-inspire-normies-to-smash-some-pigs-to-dust-prosecutors-say) who were [involved in the January 6 coup
attempt](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/paypal-says-it-blocked-christian-crowdfunding-site-givesendgo-after-it-raised-funds-for-people-attending-capitol-riots), as well as those [pushing claims of election
fraud](https://gen.medium.com/a-former-trump-operative-used-givesendgo-to-push-claims-of-election-fraud-and-rake-in-thousands-4c44172e3b1b).

The dataset is broken down by campaign and includes name, donation
amount, comments and email address.

Due to PII in the dataset and the inclusion of campaigns not involved in
violence or extremism, the dataset is only being offered to journalists
and researchers.
