A pair of databases of approximately 37,000 police in El Salvador,
containing identification numbers, names, telephone numbers, office
assignment information, email addresses, etc.

## Supplement

Following the initial publication, FocaLeaks provided Distributed Denial
of Secrets with additional information that indicates credentials were
compromised for multiple systems used by the Polic√≠a Nacional Civil de
El Salvador (PNC). While this information will allow the public to
identify officials, and to some extent, their activities, in its raw
form the information may have likely enabled numerous others to
compromise those same systems, which would expose the private
information of citizens of El Salvador and put members of the public at
risk. To prevent this, Distributed Denial of Secrets has redacted the
IMEI and PIN fields from the new dataset, which is being offered
alongside the previous dataset (originally released on forums
independent of DDosecrets).

To analyze and report on the dataset and the breach, DDoSecrets
partnered with
[DataBreaches.net](https://www.databreaches.net), whose reporting on the matter can be found
[here](https://www.databreaches.net/focaleaks-claims-to-have-hacked-el-salvador-police-gained-access-to-records-on-civilians-agents-and-criminal-investigations).
