A cache of files hacked from the Illinois Attorney General's office by
the ransomware crew DoppelPaymer. The total cache is allegedly "about
200 GB" that will be "progressively uploaded."

As of June 6th, 24.4 GB compressed / 36.4 GB uncompressed have been
released by the hackers, including over 110,000 emails.

## Limited Distribution and Redactions

Distributed Denial of Secrets is archiving the data and making it
available to journalists as DoppelPaymer uploads it and screening the
data for suitability for public distribution, as some of it presents
[clear privacy
issues](https://therecord.media/ransomware-gang-leaks-court-and-prisoner-files-from-illinois-attorney-general-office/#:~:text=The%20operators%20of%20the%20DopplePaymer,demand%2C%20The%20Record%20has%20learned.).

In addition to making portions of the data Limited Distribution
(specifically the parts damaging to private citizens of no particular
public interest), we are also redacting some of the data before sharing
it with journalists. We are taking this extraordinary step to maximally
protect the private information of abuse and doxing survivors who are of
no public interest, but are at risk for stalking, harassment and
physical violence. While we trust our journalist and researcher
partners, we also recognize the potential for unintentional harm and
that the redaction is a form of harm reduction. [(How to Request
