## Fuck FBI Friday: Infragard Atlanta & Unveillance

This release consists of a user list from the Atlanta, GA chapter of
InfraGard, a public-private information sharing network operated by the
FBI and the inbox of Karim Hijazi, then the CEO of Unveillance, a now
defunct cybersecurity
company.[[1]](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/unveillance)

## Fuck FBI Friday II: IRCFederal

## Fuck FBI Friday III: ManTech International

For the third in the series, Antisec turns their attention to ManTech
International, a defense contractor specializing in cybersecurity and
private intelligence work. They tenuously connect this breach to the FFF
family of releases by citing that ManTech had won a contract with the
FBI to maintain their network
security.[[2]](http://web.archive.org/web/20120423040719/http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/security/226700486) The release itself is made up of internal
presentations, candidate resumes, and contract records from the U.S.
Army and NATO.

## Fuck FBI Friday IV: Vanguard Defense Industries

This release sees a return to InfraGard and the world of police and
business partnership under the umbrella of "Critical Infrastructure-Key
Resources" through the inbox of Richard T. Garcia, a senior vice
president at Vanguard Defense Industries, a contractor with a focus in
this area. The emails for this release are handily organized by subject.

## Fuck FBI Friday V: IACS Cybercrime Investigators

## Fuck FBI Friday VI: Boston Police Department

This release also includes the conference call between FBI and British
police representatives.

## Fuck FBI Friday VII: Puckett & Faraj

Hack of the law firm that represented Frank Wuterich, a participant in
the Haditha massacre. The release statement claimed this was in response
to the differing standards to which Wuterich and Chelsea Manning were
held for their actions as their trials took place within months of each
other.
