A partial set of Syrian emails hacked by LulzSec, consisting only of the
emails in the archive released by WikiLeaks. The archive contains only a
portion of the Syria emails released on WikiLeaks' website, which
itself is missing over 1,000,000 emails provided to WikiLeaks by
Anonymous which remain unpublished.

While the hack itself was **not** directly sponsored or conducted by the
United States, it and the subsequent leak to WikiLeaks carried out under
the direct supervision of the United States via the FBI informant Hector
"Sabu" Monsegur.
