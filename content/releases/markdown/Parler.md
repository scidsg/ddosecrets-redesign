Over a million videos and a million images uploaded to Parler, including
ones from the January 6 Washington D.C. coup attempt. "Everything we
grabbed was publicly available on the web, we just made a permanent
public snapshot of it," one source told
[Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dpkvx/every-video-ever-posted-to-parler-is-now-available-to-download).

A preliminary analysis of Parler [has been
published](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03820.pdf) by Max Aliapoulios, Emmi Bevensee, Jeremy Blackburn,
Barry Bradlyn, Emiliano De Cristofaro, Gianluca Stringhini, & Savvas
Zannettou as ["A Large Open Dataset from the Parler Social
Network.](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4442460)"
