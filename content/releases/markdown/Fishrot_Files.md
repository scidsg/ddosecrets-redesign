Approximately 75,000 files and emails from
[Samherji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samherji "wikipedia:Samherji"),
exposing corruption in the fishing industry in a scandal extending from
Iceland to Namibia, Norway and beyond. Since 2019, the Fishrot Files
have kicked off a series of investigations and trials that are
continuing into 2023.

The emails, reports, documents, presentations and photos dating between
2010 and 2016 expose Samherji's use of bribery and false promises to
control the fishing industry, with company operations in Canada, the
Faroe Islands, France, Iceland, Germany, Namibia, Poland, Portugal,
Spain, and the U.K. The dataset is more than twice the size of what was
previously released by WikiLeaks.
