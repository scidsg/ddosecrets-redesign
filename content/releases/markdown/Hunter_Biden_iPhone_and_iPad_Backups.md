## Limited Distribution

Due to verification issues, the possibility of tampering, sensitive
media, and the legal issues surrounding decryption of the backups, we
have not attempted to use the alleged decryption keys or passwords and
are only offering our copy of the data on a Limited Distribution basis
to journalists and researchers.

## **Origins of the Laptop**

According to a 2022 CBS News report, one of Hunter Biden's laptops was
left in the Newburyport, Massachusetts's office of his therapist, Dr.
Keith Ablow. The office was later raided in an unrelated later, and the
laptop was seized by the DEA.

A few weeks later, what Hunter Biden's lawyers say was a different
laptop was allegedly left with a legally blind man at a computer repair
shop, along with other laptops. Though the computer store clerk, John
Paul Mac Isaac, is unable to identify the person who left the laptops,
the paperwork allegedly identified Hunter Biden. The laptops were never
picked up by the owner, and eventually considered abandoned property.

John Paul Mac Isaac has said that he first saw and read or reviewed some
of the files on the machines while performing the file recovery. He said
he found these files interesting and alarming, which led to him making
contact with the FBI and others, at times through proxies such as his
father.

Hunter Biden has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of the
laptops from the repair shop.

## **Source issues and discrepancies**

As reported by The Daily Beast, John Paul Mac Isaac has contradicted
himself repeatedly (see here for audio). CBS also noted he contradicted
himself in his interview with them, and invoked debunked conspiracy
theories like Seth Rich. He has declined to clarify his relationship
with Giuliani, indicating to The Daily Beast that he doesn't want to
discuss "details that transpired between December 9th and the beginning
of September."

Notably, Mac Isaac has since warned about false claims others have made
about the contents of the laptops.

## **Allegations of State Sponsorship**

Dozens of former intelligence officials have co-signed a letter that
said the Hunter Biden laptop affair "has all the classic earmarks of a
Russian information operation." Then-Director of National Intelligence
(DNI) John Ratcliffe contradicted this allegation of state sponsorship.
The matter is under FBI investigation.

During this time period, Giuliani has met with and worked with Andrii
Derkach, who the Treasury Department considers "an active Russian
agent" and who was alleged by the DNI to be using leaks to undermine
the candidacy of Joe Biden. Giuliani estimated the odds that he'd
worked with a Russian spy "no better than 50/50". According to
Derkach, the "incriminating" information is on the second laptop -
further indicating his possible involvement.
