Over 100,000 emails from the Nuclear Power Production and Development
Company of Iran, which owns the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant Operation
Company and runs Iranian research and development in the nuclear fuel
cycle, including uranium exploration, mining and conversion.

It has previously been linked to Iran's proliferation of nuclear
weapons by the European Union in 2007 and the British and Japanese
governments in 2015, and was removed from the E.U. list in January 2016
as part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
