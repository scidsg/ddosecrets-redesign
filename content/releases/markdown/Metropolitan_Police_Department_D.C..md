## The Redaction Process

Distributed Denial of Secrets is immediately making the data available
to journalists and researchers ([How to Request
Access](Contact.html#Request_Access "Contact")), and is in the process
of reviewing it for portions that can be publicly released.

## Contents

The hackers released the following screenshots (click to view enlarged
versions) showing what they had access to and what is presumably
contained in the data that is being released. The screenshots are
offered to maintain a complete record and to offer a preliminary
overview to journalists, researchers and curious citizens.

## Emails

Distributed Denial of Secrets has located and converted **74,874**
emails from the largely inaccessible .PST format to the universal .EML
format, which are being made available to the public. The most recent
collection of emails can be downloaded
[here](../images/6/6d/MPD_emails.torrent). The emails come from the lead civilian analyst for the
Department's Intelligence Branch.

Some email conversions are also being provided directly to journalists
and researchers.This includes **17,690** emails from the Director of
Human Resources as well as **6,022** emails from then-intern [Marvin
"Ben"
Haiman](https://web.archive.org/web/20200808153727/https://mpdc.dc.gov/biography/marvin-haiman), now the Executive Director of the Professional
Development Bureau and former Director for the Homeland Security
Advisory Council for DHS.

The **98,586** emails are organized by archive, retain their original
folder structure and are organized chronologically. Due to the way the
emails were extracted and converted, they may not pass DKIM inspection.
Forensic evaluation should only be performed on the original archives,
as the conversions are provided only for convenience of journalists and
other researchers.
