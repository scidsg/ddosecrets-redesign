## Who we are

## What is DDoSecrets?

Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) is a [501(c)(3)
non-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization "wikipedia:501(c)(3) organization"),
and the most active and trusted leaks organization on the planet. We're
constantly publishing new submissions from whistleblowers, activist
groups, and others to bring truth to light.

## Are you journalists?

Yes. DDoSecrets is a journalist organization dedicated to transparency
and enabling important reporting from outlets across the world. We
review and publish datasets, at times redacting them, and provide
assistance and leads to other journalists. We are not and don't attempt
to be an "all-in-one" shop, but rather one part of the larger
ecosystem of journalism.

## Where do you obtain your data from?

Unless already public, or if authorized by a source, we do not disclose
the identity of a source. We are fully committed to ensuring the
anonymity of the people who provide us with data, and protecting them
from all threats.

We source much of our material from private dataset collectors, leakers,
hacktivists, and public places. Every set is different. As a general
approach, we avoid naming the specific means by which we obtained a
dataset. This is both to save the time it would take to detail each
submission, and to protect our sources.

## What we do

## Why are you releasing this information?

We have a common goal: transparency. If data is already public, or could
be regardless if we were here, then we believe it is best that a stable
and reliable publisher ensure that material is properly examined. We do
not conduct thorough investigations into already public material, nor
seek to derive conclusions from it. Individual members of the collective
may have their own opinions on some of our materials. This does not
change the neutral position that the collective wishes to maintain when
handling data.

## Is there information you don't release?

There are a number of datasets -- some as large as a terabyte -- that
we've received and declined to publish for various reasons, such as a
lack of a clear public interest, or for the source's safety. For the
protection of sources as well as economic reasons, we don't retain
rejected data. [With limited
exceptions](https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/exclusive-nato-classified-cloud-platform), we do not acknowledge rejected datasets.

## What is "Limited Distribution"?

We aim to make as much information as possible publicly available, but
at times principled leaking and responsible disclosure demand a more
careful approach. When datasets contain especially sensitive data, or
large amounts of personally identifiable information or PII, we may
redact the PII data or limit its availability to journalists and
researchers, as dictated by the situation and requested by the source.

If you think of DDoSecrets as a library, then the Limited Distribution
category of our archive is like the 'rare books', or Restricted
Section of a library. Researchers with a history of publishing
investigations can request access to the collections in this category by
demonstrating with their body of work that they have a responsible
approach to PII data.

## How do you verify your data?

Each dataset must be up to scratch of a prima facie investigation. In
simple terms, this is not our stamp of approval for data being
legitimate, but that in our opinion it *appears to be* legitimate. Some
data by the nature of it will inhibit or limit our investigations prior
to releasing it publicly, and we carefully consider any doubts raised on
the veracity of published information.

Where data authenticity is in question, we will ensure any known
concerns are clearly marked in the editor notes with any supporting
published opinions. We encourage all objections or criticism on data
authenticity to be publicly available so it may be referenced and
transparent. As WikiLeaks noted in its early days, making the
information available and "bringing the collective wisdoms and
experiences of thousands to politically important documents will unmask
frauds like never before."

## What does the Board of Advisors do?

The Board of Advisors help shape the long-term goals and vision of
Distributed Denial of Secrets by providing continuous guidance and
feedback on how to adapt and do better. In the event that the primary
administrators are incapacitated or otherwise fail to meet the practical
and moral standards required by the work, the Board are able to transfer
authority and credentials to DDoS servers and accounts.

## Legal and safety

## Is this website illegal?

We're a federally recognized 501(c)(3) journalist non-profit protected
by the First Amendment to the US Constitution, UDHR Article 19, CFR
Article 11, et al.

Our website and the contents we list are entirely legal [in all sane and
reasonable
jurisdictions](https://twitter.com/NatSecGeek/status/1538546466242940928) - both to view our website and download the
contents we offer. This being said, we are not legal professionals and
we simply cannot provide qualified opinions on matters of law. If in
doubt, it is always advised that you consult qualified legal
professionals under Attorney-Client privilege.

## Have you ever been subject to any gagging or national security notices or requests?

No - we have not.

## Is downloading your data safe?

There is no perfect procedure for transferring data to us or anyone
else. We can act as a shield, and share advice from our experience.
Often our role is to not just to make data available, but to act as a
anonymity guard to make information available to those best positioned
to interrogate it.

Users should be careful when handling raw data, which is offered as-is.
Updated antivirus software and sandboxed environments are recommended,
especially for deep dives.

## Does DDoSecrets hack [XYZ?]

No.

## Can I hack [XYZ and give the data to DDoSecrets?]

No. For ethical and legal reasons, you should not hack data specifically
to give it to Distributed Denial of Secrets to make public. However, we
welcome submissions from leakers and hackers who review data they have
access to and then conclude it should be made public.

## Technical

## I don't understand how to open or view the information, can you help?

We may be able to provide limited assistance to journalists we have
worked with before, but this is subject to the availability of
collective members.

## The torrents are slow to download

For a faster and smoother experience, we recommend renting a seedbox to
download the torrents. Files can then be transferred to local devices
through sftp or rsync. Several seedbox services allow payment with
Bitcoin, making anonymous use possible.

Some data is available for download from
[data.ddosecrets.com](https://data.ddosecrets.com), though torrents are always the preferred download
method.

## Do you have any backup or other official addresses other than [ddosxlvzzow7scc7egy75gpke54hgbg2frahxzaw6qq5osnzm7wistid.onion(http://ddosxlvzzow7scc7egy75gpke54hgbg2frahxzaw6qq5osnzm7wistid.onion)?]

`DDoSecrets.com` acts as a clearnet version of the Distributed Denial of
Secrets index,
[http://ddosxlvzzow7scc7egy75gpke54hgbg2frahxzaw6qq5osnzm7wistid.onion](http://ddosxlvzzow7scc7egy75gpke54hgbg2frahxzaw6qq5osnzm7wistid.onion). We recommend users take advantage of the security
benefits offered by the Tor Hidden Service. We strongly recommend using
Tor Browser to visit our .onion address where possible, as browsing via
the clearnet does not provide the same level of security or privacy
benefits.

## Why are you on the dark net?

Our recommended use of Tor Onion Services ("Hidden Services" or "Dark
Net") is to ensure the anonymity of our users, and reduce the legal
difficulties projects like ours would normally encounter. Tor enables us
to publish freely, reduces the risk of interference in our operations
and protects the anonymity of all of our visitors - even we cannot see
who is visiting our website. We strongly believe the "safety by default"
approach is in the best interests of all.

## Is it possible to search the archive?

Some data can be searched at
[Search.DDoSecrets.com](https://Search.DDoSecrets.com), more will be added as time and resources allow. The
[Hunter Memorial Library](https://hunter.ddosecrets.com) can be used to search specific datasets, and is only
available to journalists and researchers at this time.

## Other

## How can you say you're not political when you're antifascists?

We believe that anti-fascism is and should be the default for any
civilized entity, and that secrecy directly enables corruption and
fascism.

## Awesome project - how can I help?

We are always looking for assistance in curating our data, whether this
is providing information missing from the tables, providing links to
interesting and reliable news sources on the content, or submitting new
data you may have access to.

Our project is funded entirely by our collective and by donations. As
our collective receives external financial assistance, we will provide
[full
transparency](https://opencollective.com/ddosecrets/transactions?type=CREDIT) on this as well as any agreed terms or
requirements linked to funding.

See also our [Contribute](Contribute.html "Contribute") page.

## I'm a journalist, can I get advance access to data prior to public release?

Possibly. We do not operate any partnerships or guarantees as we feel
this is against our modus operandi, but if you are a specialist in a
particular field we will consider an advance release to allow you to
more thoroughly research the matter in question. It is best to contact
us in advance if you have particular fields of interest and we will note
your request and review suitability before every release.
