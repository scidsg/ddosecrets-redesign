Photographs of classified documents leaked by U.S. Airman Jack Teixeira
from the 102nd Intelligence Wing of the Massachusetts Air National
Guard. Teixeira posted transcribed documents and photographs of
documents to a series of Discord channels.

**Note:** The information in the documents consists mostly of summarized
intelligence reports, with some brief analysis. While invaluable to the
public for the insight it gives into current events and the decisions of
public figures and government, the information is not always accurate or
fully contextualized. The information was recent when it became public,
but it is not up-to-date.
