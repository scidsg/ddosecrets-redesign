Approximately 19,000 emails from Ethiopia's Financial Intelligence
Service, previously known as the Financial Intelligence Center, the
government agency responsible for monitoring suspicious financial
transactions in the country.

## Embargo

During an initial embargo, the data was shared with the [Platform to
Protect Whistleblowers in Africa](https://www.pplaaf.org/) (PPLAAF), which shared its findings with various
media partners: Bloomberg in the United States; Süddeutsche Zeitung in
Germany; Tamedia in Switzerland; and The Continent in South Africa.

The media partners independently evaluated the materials and used other
sources of information to verify the internal documents and shed light
on both the government investigation and a broader intimidation campaign
[including a politically motivated
investigation](https://www.pplaaf.org/2023/09/29/world-health-organization-director-general-targeted-by-ethiopian-government.html) against former Ethiopian minister and director
general of the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2017, Dr. Tedros
Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

PPLAAF and the media partners sent requests for comment to Ethiopian
government entities, those targeted by or referenced in the
investigation, and others. The Ethiopian government did not respond to
any of these requests.

## Limited Distribution

Due to widespread presence of PII such as identification documents, the
data is only being made available to journalists and researchers. [(How
