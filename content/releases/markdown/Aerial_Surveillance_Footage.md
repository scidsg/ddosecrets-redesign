Over 600 hours of aerial surveillance footage taken by police
helicopters in and around Dallas, TX and Atlanta, GA.

The extensive footage reveals the capabilities of the "military-grade"
technology behind police surveillance. It also highlights the voyeurism
inherent in surveillance and how it often focuses on protected first
amendment activities and people who have no idea they're being watched
and who've done nothing to justify the intrusion of surveillance.
