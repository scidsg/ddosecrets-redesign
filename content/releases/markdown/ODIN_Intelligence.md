**EDITOR NOTES**

---

19 GB including thousands of photos, audio recordings, reports and user
information from ODIN Intelligence and SweepWizard, a pair of apps
geared towards law enforcement that primarily target houseless people.

Some of the reports appear to contain inaccurate information, such as
listing officer's names as "Superman," "Captain America," "Joe
Blow," etc. and false phone numbers. Some of the reports also indicate
that Erik McCauley and his wife were involved in some of the law
enforcement operations, and that EJM Digital, which was previously a
parent company for ODIN Intelligence and SweepWizard, sponsored some of
those law enforcement operations.
