150,000 files from the spyware reseller WebDetetive, a phone monitoring
app typically installed on phones without the user's consent (or even
knowledge). The software uploads the contents of the user's phone to
its servers, messages, call logs, phone call recordings, photos, ambient
recordings from the phone's microphone and GPS data.

The data does not include include files from the victims' devices.
WebDetetive does not verify customer email addresses when signing up.

## Research

[A Brazilian phone spyware was hacked and victims' devices 'deleted'
from
server](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/26/brazil-webdetetive-spyware-deleted/) (TechCrunch)

## Limited Distribution

Due to widespread presence of PII such as identification documents, the
data is only being made available to journalists and researchers.
