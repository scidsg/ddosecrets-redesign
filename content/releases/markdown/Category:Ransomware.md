From Distributed Denial of Secrets

Ransomware is a new category of data leak that we can't ignore. Several
ransomware crews have begun releasing data which they hacked and
published on their own leak sites. Early in our lifecycle, we published
[Perceptics](Perceptics.html "Perceptics") in our index, and are aware
of the public interest of that data set, which came from a ransomware
origin. Since then, we have seen other public interest datasets in the
ransomware category, and want to be upfront about the nature of the
sources in republishing this data.

To ignore them would not be true to our mission to be a useful archive
and leaks library. We consider it irresponsible to allow data sources to
be accessible only to private entities, privatizing knowledge. We wish
for a broader public to examine the data, and to encourage scholarship.

As always, there is a danger to publishing that which others would keep
secret. Our willingness to engage with a wide range of data, and to
protect the sources, has given media and prosecutors in the Bahamas and
Germany an excuse to confuse themselves, by conflating publishers with
sources.

While data obtained by ransomware hackers can be just as valuable as
data leaked by insiders or obtained by hacktivists, it's worth noting
that DDoSecrets is not receiving or publishing previously unreleased
ransomware datasets. **All datasets have been previously released on the
dark web in one form or another by the hackers.** DDoSecrets is simply
preserving and making that information available to journalists,
researchers and the public. We have no special knowledge of, involvement
with or access to their potential upcoming releases.

As a rule, we will not become involved with or share any ransomware data
obtained from social services or medical practices such as hospitals and
doctors offices. Other datasets, such as ones obtained from educational
institutions, may be shared privately with journalists and researchers,
but will not be redistributed publicly.

All ransomware datasets are offered **as-is**, and users are strongly
encouraged to check data with the latest antivirus software and
definitions, as well as to examine the data using sandbox solutions such
as
[Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases) for Windows or the
[Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
operating system.
