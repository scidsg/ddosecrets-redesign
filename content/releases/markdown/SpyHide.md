Source code and user data for the Android spyware software SpyHide
dating from 2016 through mid-July 2023.

Although SpyHide's software was made in Iran and the servers were
hosted in Germany, TechCrunch's analysis identified at least 750,000
users and about 60,000 compromised devices in a surveillance network
that spans every continent.

## Research

## Limited Distribution

Due to widespread presence of PII such as identification documents, the
data is only being made available to journalists and researchers.
