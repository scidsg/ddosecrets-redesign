From Distributed Denial of Secrets

The **Casolaro Files** represent the surviving notebooks, files,
clippings and draft writings by journalist Danny Casolaro, detailing his
investigations into some of the most prominent American political
controversies of the 1980s and early 90s; drawing connections in a cabal
he referred to as "The Octopus". These records are held by the State
Historical Society of Missouri as part of their collection on the
Arizona Project and were photographed by Christian Hansen.
