Thousands of emails allegedly from Brexist supporters including former
British spymaster Richard Dearlove, campaigner Gisela Stuart, historian
Robert Tombs, and others.

Be aware that the emails are almost certainly incomplete and
cherry-picked.

## Allegations of State Sponsorship

According to Reuters' reporting:

> Shane Huntley, who directs Google's Threat Analysis Group, told
> Reuters that the "English Coop" website was linked to what the
> Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O)-owned company knew as "Cold River," a
> Russia-based hacking group.
>
>
> "We're able to see that through technical indicators," Huntley
> said.
>
>
>
> Huntley said that the entire operation -- from Cold River's hacking
> attempts to publicizing the leaks -- had "clear technical links"
> between one another.

Thomas Rid, a cybersecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, also
pointed out similarities in the MO between to Guccifer 2.0 and
[DCLeaks](Podesta_emails.html "Podesta emails").

This dataset was released in the buildup to, in the midst of, or in the
aftermath of a cyberwar or hybrid war. Therefore, there is an increased
chance of malware, ulterior motives and altered or implanted data, or
false flags/fake personas. **As a result, we encourage readers,

Any specific concerns will be added and noted below.

- Dearlove, one of the victims, who led Britain's foreign spy
service - known as MI6 - between 1999 and 2004, told Reuters the
leaked material should be treated with caution given "[the context
of the present crisis in relations with
Russia.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-russian-hackers-are-linked-new-brexit-leak-website-google-says-2022-05-25/)"
