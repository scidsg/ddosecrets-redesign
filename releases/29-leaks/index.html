The existence of #29 Leaks data was announced by Barrett Brown of Pursuance Project on July 29, 2019.[1]Research into the data was carried out over the next several months by a group including independent researchers, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, and the Pursuance Project. The release was published on Dec. 4, 2020.</p><p>The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project works with one media outlet per country, and restricts access to their Aleph research platform to approved journalists. Upon publication of #29 Leaks, DDoSecrets launched its instance of Aleph called Hunter, which was open to the public. OCCRP only partially processed #29 data, and made an incomplete set available to their restricted list of journalists. As of May 26 (see: BlueLeaks), Hunter Memorial Library had indexed and made searchable more than 10 million #29 Leaks emails. OCCRP made available to their network only 880,000 emails. As a result, some early media reports included incorrect information about the total size of the cache. Christopher Guess, who helped OCCRP process the leak, estimated the total size at 50 million emails and published the specific tools he created during the course of the research.[2]</p><p>Media outlets that published stories:</p><ul><li>Crikey (Australia)</li><li>The Times (UK)</li><li>Ostro (Slovenia)</li><li>KRIK (Serbia)</li><li>The News (Pakistan)</li><li>Finance Uncovered (UK)</li><li>Suddeutsche Zeitung (Germany)</li><li>South China Morning Post (Hong Kong)</li><li>NBC (US)</li><li>Economic Times (India)</li></ul><h3 id=timeline>Timeline</h3><p>British-Pakistani Nadeem Khan founded Formations House in 2002.</p><p>The UK charged Nadeem Khan in April 2014 with alleged involvement in a €100 million fraud case.</p><p>The trial never happened. Khan died in September 2015 at the age of 54.</p><p>The Karachi Formations House office was reportedly closed in 2017 when family differences after Nadeem’s death boiled over into a &ldquo;feud&rdquo; between his children and brothers.[3]</p><p>Khan&rsquo;s step-daughter Charlotte Pawar and his son Darius Khan inherited and continued the UK business.</p><h3 id=findings>Findings</h3><p>In April 2012, Senegalese-Canadian Mouhamadou Mouctar Diagne formed a business in the home district of The Gambia&rsquo;s dictator, Yahya Jammeh. Diagne and Khan made public commitments to develop infrastructure, but only ended up building some houses inside the compound of the ruling family. One year later, in April 2013, Diagne and business partner Nadeem Khan, requested a meeting with Yahya Jammeh.[4]They pitched the creation of a &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; business park to attract foreign direct investment with reduced oversight. Gambia granted a concession for a Khan/Diagne company registered in the Seychelles to own 500 hectares of land near the Banjul airport. However, no business park ever materialized.</p><p>Formations House did create a parallel and unofficial Gambian business registry, staffed by a call center in Pakistan, which was not endorsed by the Gambian state. The fake Gambian business registry was incorporated in the UK, which caused Gambia to fail in its attempts to shut it down. Formations House used this fake business registry to sell concocted Gambian companies, including banks, to their international clients via their company formation agency in the UK.</p><h3 id=references>References</h3><p><a href=https://www.ostro.si/en/stories/a-vehicle-for-fraud>https://www.ostro.si/en/stories/a-vehicle-for-fraud</a></p><p><a href=https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/12/04/29-leaks-story-background/>https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/12/04/29-leaks-story-background/</a></p><p><a href=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/578792-uk-company-accused-of-facilitating-fraudsters-operated-from-karachi>https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/578792-uk-company-accused-of-facilitating-fraudsters-operated-from-karachi</a></p><p><a href=https://www.occrp.org/en/29leaks/road-to-nowhere>https://www.occrp.org/en/29leaks/road-to-nowhere</a>
