for data leaked in the public interest, with news coverage from around
the world.</p><p>We are a small group, but our reach expands far beyond just our members.
Our founders had informally worked together and developed deep
connections in the field of data gathering, research, journalism,
activism and technology. In 2018, they decided to pool their expertise
and time to create a project representing shared transparency goals, and
provide an information sharing platform for others to know and trust.</p><p>Data we index must meet two criteria:</p><ul><li>Is it in the public interest?</li><li>Can a prima facie case be made for the veracity of its contents?</li></ul><p>Since 2018, we&rsquo;ve grown by leaps and bounds, released dozens of
terabytes of data from over fifty countries, worked with countless
outlets and partnered with groups like the Organized Crime and
Corruption Reporting Project, European Investigative Collaborations, the
SilverLining Project at Harvard University&rsquo;s Institute for Quantitative
Social Science and the Social Media Analysis Toolkit (SMAT).</p><p>Our view is that data is a resource and a record. Data can never tell
the whole story. We trust the public to be responsible with data, and
open it up to them for rigorous examination. Given enough time and data,
the truth can always emerge.</p><p>As of July 2020, we are a registered 501(c)3 non-profit.</p><p>You can read more about the collective
