media, we are only offering our copy of the data on a Limited
Distribution basis to journalists and researchers.</p><h2 id=origins-of-the-laptop><strong>Origins of the Laptop</strong></h2><p>According to a 2022 CBS News report, one of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptops was
left in the Newburyport, Massachusetts&rsquo;s office of his therapist, Dr.
Keith Ablow. The office was later raided in an unrelated later, and the
laptop was seized by the DEA.</p><p>A few weeks later, what Hunter Biden&rsquo;s lawyers say was a different
laptop was allegedly left with a legally blind man at a computer repair
shop, along with other laptops. Though the computer store clerk, John
Paul Mac Isaac, is unable to identify the person who left the laptops,
the paperwork allegedly identified Hunter Biden. The laptops were never
picked up by the owner, and eventually considered abandoned property.</p><p>John Paul Mac Isaac has said that he first saw and read or reviewed some
of the files on the machines while performing the file recovery. He said
he found these files interesting and alarming, which led to him making
contact with the FBI and others, at times through proxies such as his
father.</p><p>Hunter Biden has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of the
laptops from the repair shop.</p><h2 id=source-issues-and-discrepancies><strong>Source issues and discrepancies</strong></h2><p>As reported by The Daily Beast, John Paul Mac Isaac has contradicted
himself repeatedly (see here for audio). CBS also noted he contradicted
himself in his interview with them, and invoked debunked conspiracy
theories like Seth Rich. He has declined to clarify his relationship
with Giuliani, indicating to The Daily Beast that he doesn&rsquo;t want to
discuss &ldquo;details that transpired between December 9th and the beginning
of September.&rdquo;</p><p>Notably, Mac Isaac has since warned about false claims others have made
about the contents of the laptops.</p><h2 id=timeline-discrepancies><strong>Timeline discrepancies</strong></h2><ul><li>March 28, 2018: The original &lsquo;Macintosh HD&rsquo; drive was created.</li><li>February, 2019: Hunter Biden leaves a laptop in the office of his

of the data sometime in 2019 or 2020. According to a defamation court
filing, in August 2020, Mac Isaac contacted Rudy Giuliani&rsquo;s lawyer, Mr.
Costello, and provided him with the data. Mac Isaac&rsquo;s court filing in
the defamation suit states that he never communicated with Giuliani, a
statement which appeared contradicted by his various interviews (see
below).</p><p>In an attempt to swing the 2020 election with an October Surprise, Steve
Bannon and Rudy Giuliani provided the data to the New York Post.</p><p>According to multiple sources, then-President Trump had been aware of
the effort to publish data from the laptop. According to Giuliani, in
addition to briefing Trump, he alerted Senators Ron Johnson
(R-Wisconsin) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). Giuliani believed Rep. Devin
Nunes (R-California) also received the data.</p><h2 id=allegations-of-state-sponsorship><strong>Allegations of State Sponsorship</strong></h2><p>Dozens of former intelligence officials have co-signed a letter that
said the Hunter Biden laptop affair &ldquo;has all the classic earmarks of a
Russian information operation.&rdquo; Then-Director of National Intelligence
(DNI) John Ratcliffe contradicted this allegation of state sponsorship.
The matter is under FBI investigation.</p><p>During this time period, Giuliani has met with and worked with Andrii
Derkach, who the Treasury Department considers &ldquo;an active Russian
agent&rdquo; and who was alleged by the DNI to be using leaks to undermine
the candidacy of Joe Biden. Giuliani estimated the odds that he&rsquo;d
worked with a Russian spy &ldquo;no better than 50/50&rdquo;. According to
Derkach, the &ldquo;incriminating&rdquo; information is on the second laptop -
further indicating his possible involvement.</p><p>Retrieved from
