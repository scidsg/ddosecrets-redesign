the remainder (a small minority of the files) is only being provided to
journalists and researchers due to the presence of PII, financial
information, passwords, decryption keys and other information which
could be abused.</p><h2 id=research>Research</h2><p>Founded in 2009 in reaction to the election of Barrack Obama as US
President, the Oath Keepers are a loosely organized assembly of partisan
Republicans and Independents acting upon right wing conspiracy theories
involving a totalitarian Democrat-run federal government working in
concert with assorted shadowy global cabals.</p><p>Oath Keepers target sympathetic members of the Law Enforcement, First
Responder, and Military communities and the Republican Party for
memberships. Journalists parsing the Oath Keepers leak have confirmed
that of 38,000 members recorded, almost 1,400 were active or former Law
Enforcement, more than 100 were active Military, more than 100 more were
First Responders, and some 81 were politicians in or running for office.
Oath Keeper membership policies and practices mean these numbers are
possibly under-reported. Members waiting for membership packages after
paying their dues have complained of delays, and about the Oath Keeper
executive using membership funds for phone games, liquor and online
pornography.</p><p>Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and four others are on trial for
their involvement in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol
Building. The Oath Keepers have used conspiracy theories about the
imminent threat of impending federal &ldquo;decapitation strikes&rdquo; against
their organization involving mass power blackouts for fund-raising and
recruitment.</p><h2 id=national>National</h2><p>Letter from <a href=https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/markey_goldman_garcia_letter_to_dhs_on_domestic_violent_extremism_-_071723pdf1.pdf>65 Democratic congresspeople to Secretary of Homeland
